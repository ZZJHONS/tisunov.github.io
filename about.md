Hi, I'm Pavel Tisunov.

I love building software solutions to real problems, my areas of interest are mobile applications, startups, travel, snowboarding, video shooting and editing, drones.

I've been building software since I was 14 starting from ZX Spectrum. Right now I'm builing iOS and Rails applications, learning Machine Learning, exploring AI especially Recurrent Neural Networks.
